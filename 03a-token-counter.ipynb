              "- Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019): extends autoregressive / sequence models with a segment-level recurrence + relative positional encoding so the model can reuse previous hidden states and capture longer-term dependency for language modeling / generation.\n",
              "- Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020): replaces dense self-attention with a sparse attention pattern (sliding window local attention + optional global tokens) so attention cost grows roughly linearly with sequence length — great for long-document encoding tasks (QA, classification, RAG).\n",

              "\n",
              "1) How they extend context\n",
              "- Transformer-XL:\n",
              "  - Keeps a fixed-length “memory” of previous segments’ hidden states and feeds that into the next segment’s computation.\n",
              "  - Uses relative positional encodings so the model can reason across the boundary between cached memory and current tokens without position collisions.\n",
              "  - Designed especially for autoregressive language modeling; improves perplexity by enabling longer dependency without retraining on gigantic contiguous sequences.\n",
              "- Longformer:\n",
              "  - Changes the attention mechanism itself to be sparse: each token attends only to a fixed window of neighbors (sliding window), and a small number of tokens can be configured to use global attention so they see the whole sequence.\n",
              "  - Complexity becomes roughly O(L * window) instead of O(L^2), so it scales to very long sequences (thousands of tokens).\n",

              "- Transformer-XL: still uses dense attention on the concatenation of memory + current tokens (though the memory is cached), so per-step attention is quadratic in the effective segment+memory length. In practice you control memory length to bound cost. The recurrence avoids recomputing earlier layers for every token across long spans.\n",

              "3) Positional encoding\n",

They range from classic Hierarchical Attention Networks (RNN + attention) to hierarchical BERTs (sentence encoder + document encoder), to modern set/transformer-based pooling modules (Set Transformer, attention pooling, NetVLAD). Below I list the best-known papers/approaches, explain how the second-stage (document-level) model is usually built, give quick pros/cons and training signals, and end with small pseudocode sketches you can try.\n",

              "  - Longformer: best for encoder tasks on long inputs — long-document classification, long QA, information extraction — where you want to process the whole long sequence in one forward pass.\n",
              "- Context length behavior:\n",
              "  - Transformer-XL extends context by caching previous segments; context can grow across many segments, but attention per segment still quadratic in segment size and gradients are typically truncated across segments.\n",
              "  - Longformer processes very long single sequences cheaply (linear-ish), with receptive field governed by window size / number of layers; global attention lets you connect distant parts when needed.\n",
              "- Positional encodings:\n",
              "  - Transformer-XL: uses relative positional encoding (important for segment recurrence).\n",

              "- Complexity and memory:\n",
              "  - Transformer-XL: O(S*(S+M)) per segment (memory M increases compute/memory). Good when you want long cross-segment context with autoregressive constraints.\n",

              "- Implementation & training:\n",
              "  - Transformer-XL introduces more training complexity because of the recurrence/memory handling and careful handling of positional encodings.\n",
